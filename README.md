## Setup Service

We provide extensive documentation on Github but if you’re a non-technical user or want to save yourself some work you can take advantage of our [setup and integration service](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/chat-sdk-setup-service/).

## Integration with an existing project

### Project Structure

We've tried to make it as easy as possible to add Chat SDK to your project. However since it's it's a relatively complex project with a lot of dependencies (and because of some issues with Cocoapods) the setup needs to be handeled carefully. 

So that things run smoothly, we recommend that you keep the Chat SDK Firebase Adapter library in the folder outside your Xcode project folder. A typical structure would look like this:

```
- ChatSDKFirebaseAdapter
- ChatSDKModules
- ChatSDKFirebase

- YourProject
- /---- YourProject.xcodeproj
- /---- YouProject
- /---- /---- [.m and .h files]
- /---- /---- setup_links.sh
- /---- Podfile
```

All the paths in the instructions will be provided assuming this project structure. If you use a different structure, you will need to modify the paths accordingly. 

### Adding the Chat SDK to your project

1. Download or clone the Chat SDK and put the library files in a convenient location
2. Add the Chat SDK development pods to your Podfile

  ```
  use_frameworks!
  pod "ChatSDK"
  ```

3. Add additional support pods. These are external pods that are needed by the Chat SDK

  ```
  pod "Firebase/Auth"  
  pod "Firebase/Database"  
  pod "Firebase/Messaging"  
  pod "Firebase/Storage"  
  ```
  
4. Run `pod install` or `pod update` to get the latest version of the code.
  
5. You can add the **ChatSDKFirebaseAdapter** code directly to your Xcode project or add it via symlink (see step 6). Copy the **ChatSDKFirebaseAdapter** folder from [chat-sdk-ios/ChatSDK/ChatSDKFirebaseAdapter/Classes](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/tree/master/ChatSDK/ChatSDKFirebaseAdapter/Classes) into your Xcode project. From inside Xcode, right click in the left panel click **Add Files** and add the **ChatSDKFirebaseAdapter** folder. 

  >**Note**  
  >There are currently ongoing issues with the Firebase pods which make it very difficult for us to include the Chat SDK Firebase Adapter in a pod. Until these issues are resolved, the easiest approach is to drag the files into Xcode directly. 
  
6. **Symlinking**. Alternatively, you can add the `FirebaseNetworkAdapter` using a symlink. This allows you to have one copy of the library which can be referenced by multiple Xcode projects. To setup the symlinks you need to locate the [**setup_links.sh**](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/blob/master/Xcode/ChatSDK%20Demo/setup_links.sh) script. This should be added to your Xcode project where you want to setup the symlinks (see [Project Structure](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios#project-structure)). Run the script using `sh setup_links.sh`. Enter the relative path to the ChatSDKFirebaseAdapter folder. If you use the default project structure, you can just leave this blank (the default path is `../../`). Then open Xcode and add the symlink folders using the normal process.   

7. Open the **App Delegate** add the following code to initialise the chat

  **Objective C**

  _AppDelegate.m -> application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:_
  
  ```
  #import <ChatSDK/ChatCore.h>
  #import <ChatSDK/ChatUI.h>
  #import <ChatSDK/ChatCoreData.h>
  #import "ChatFirebaseAdapter.h"
  ```

  Add the following code to the start of your didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function:

  ```
  // Create a network adapter to communicate with Firebase
  // The network adapter handles network traffic
  [BNetworkManager sharedManager].a = [[BFirebaseNetworkAdapter alloc] init];
    
  // Set the default interface manager
  [BInterfaceManager sharedManager].a = [[BDefaultInterfaceAdapter alloc] init];

  [BStorageManager sharedManager].a = [[BCoreDataManager alloc] init];
  
  // This is the main view that contains the tab bar
  UIViewController * mainViewController = [[BAppTabBarController alloc] initWithNibName:Nil bundle:Nil];

  // Set the login screen
  [BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.auth.challengeViewController = [[BLoginViewController alloc] initWithNibName:Nil bundle:Nil];

  [self.window setRootViewController:mainViewController];
  ```
  
  **Swift**
  
  _AppDelegate.swift_
  
  ```
  import ChatSDK
  ```

    Add the following to your briding header
  
  ```
  #import "ChatFirebaseAdapter.h"
  ```
  
  Add the following code to the start of your didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function:

  ```
  BInterfaceManager.shared().a = BDefaultInterfaceAdapter.init()
  BNetworkManager.shared().a = BFirebaseNetworkAdapter.init()
  BStorageManager.shared().a = BCoreDataManager.init()
  
  let mainViewController = BAppTabBarController.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
  BNetworkManager.shared().a.auth().setChallenge(BLoginViewController.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil));
        
  self.window = UIWindow.init(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
  self.window?.rootViewController = mainViewController;
  self.window?.makeKeyAndVisible();
  ```
    
8. The Chat SDK is now added to your project
9. Add the [Firebase File Storage](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios#file-storage) module which is required for image and location messages and user profile avatars. 

## Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase](http://firebase.com/) website and sign up
2. Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and make a new project
3. Click **Add project**
4. Choose a name and a location
5. Click **Settings** (the gear icon). On the General tab, click **Add Firebase to your iOS app**
6. Enter your bundle ID
7. Download the **GoogleServices** file and add it to the root of your Xcode project

  >**Note:**  
  >It is worth opening your downloaded ```GoogleService-Info.plist``` and checking there is an ```API_KEY``` field included. Sometimes Firebase's automatic download doesn’t include this in the plist. To rectify, just re-download the plist from the project settings menu.  

8. Next add the Chat SDK specific settings. Open the demo Chat SDK project and locat the **chat_sdk** entry in the **Info.plist** file. Copy this entry into the **Info.plist** file in your project.
9. Expand the entry and then expand the **firebase** settings. Set the `root_path` to a value of your choice. Set the `storage_path` to the value found in the Firebase console under the storage tab. 
  
  >**Note**  
  >The root path variable allows you to run multiple Chat SDK instances on one Firebase account. Each different root path will represent a completely separate set of Firebase data. This can be useful for testing because you could have separate test and prod root paths.
   
10. Copy the following rows from the demo ChatSDK **Info.plist** file to your project's **Info.plist**  
  1. `App Transport Security Settings`
  2. `URL types`
  3. `FacebookAppID`
  4. All the privacy rows. These will allow the app to access the camera, location and address book

11. In the Firebase dashboard click **Authentication -> Sign-in method** and enable all the appropriate methods 

## Module Setup

There are a number of free and premium extensions that can be added to the Chat SDK.

To install a module you should use the following steps:

1. Copy the module code into your Xcode source folder and add the files to your project from inside Xcode. If you are using the Symlink you can use the symlink script (mentioned above) and then just add a link to the **ChatSDKFirebase** folder to Xcode.
2. Add any necessary dependencies to your Podfile
3. Import the module's header file (or add it to the bridging header for a Swift project)
4. Activate the module in the `AppDelegate.m` file

### Social Login

The [social login module](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/tree/master/ChatSDKFirebase/FirebaseSocialLogin) allows you to support user authentication using some popular social networks including Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus. 

After adding the **SocialLogin** files to your Xcode project, add the following to your Podfile:

```
pod 'TwitterKit', '2.3'
pod 'GoogleSignIn'
pod 'FBSDKLoginKit'
```

**Objective C**

_AppDelegate.m -> application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:_

```
 #import "BFirebaseSocialLoginModule.h"

[[[BFirebaseSocialLoginModule alloc] init] activateWithApplication:application withOptions:launchOptions];

```

Also add this function:

```
// During the Facebook login flow, your app passes control to the Facebook iOS app or Facebook in a mobile browser.
// After authentication, your app will be called back with the session information.
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
            openURL:(NSURL *)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication
         annotation:(id)annotation
{
    if ([BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.socialLogin) {
        return [[BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.socialLogin application:application openURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
    }
    return NO;
}
```

**Swift**

_[YourProject]-Bridging-Header.h_

```
 #import "BFirebaseSocialLoginModule.h"
```

_AppDelegate.swift_

```
BFirebaseSocialLoginModule.init().activate(with: application, withOptions: launchOptions);
```

Also add this function:

```
func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {
    if(BNetworkManager.shared().a.socialLogin() != nil) {
        return BNetworkManager.shared().a.socialLogin().application(application, open: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation)
    }
    return false
}
```

Follow the social login [setup guides](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/wiki). 

### Push Notifications

The Push Notification module allows you to send free push notifications using Firebase Clound Messenger.

After adding the [Push Notifications](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/tree/master/ChatSDKFirebase/FirebasePush) module to your Xcode project, add the following to the App Delegate to enable the module.

**Objective C**

_AppDelegate.m -> application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:_

```
 #import "BFirebasePushModule.h"

[[[BFirebasePushModule alloc] init] activateForFirebaseWithApplication:application withOptions:launchOptions];
```

Also add these functions:

```
-(void) application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    [[BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.push application:application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}

-(void) application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {
    [[BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.push application:application didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
}
```

**Swift**

_[YourProject]-Bridging-Header.h_

```
 #import "BFirebasePushModule.h"
```

_AppDelegate.swift_

```
BFirebasePushModule.init().activateForFirebase(with: application, withOptions: launchOptions);
```

Also add these functions:

```
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    if (BNetworkManager.shared().a.push() != nil) {
        BNetworkManager.shared().a.push().application(application, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: deviceToken)
    }
}
    
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
    if (BNetworkManager.shared().a.push() != nil) {
        BNetworkManager.shared().a.push().application(application, didReceiveRemoteNotification: userInfo)
    }
}
```

Then follow the Firebase Push notification [setup guide](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/wiki/FIrebase-Push-Notification-Setup). 

### File Storage

The [File Storage module](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/tree/master/ChatSDKFirebase/FirebaseFileStorage) allows you to send image messages. These messages are stored on the Firebase server. 

After adding the files to your Xcode project, add the following to the App Delegate to enable the module.

**Objective C**

_AppDelegate.m -> application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:_

```
 #import "BFirebaseFileStorageModule.h"

[[[BFirebaseFileStorageModule alloc] init] activateForFirebase];
```

**Swift**

_[YourProject]-Bridging-Header.h_

```
 #import "BFirebaseFileStorageModule.h"
```

_AppDelegate.swift_

```
BFirebaseFileStorageModule.init().activateForFirebase();
```

Ensure that the file storage path has been setup. 

1. Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click the **Storage** tab
3. Copy the storage URL which starts with `gs://`
4. Paste it into your **Info.plist** file at the location **chat_sdk** -> **firebase** -> **storage_path**

### Firebase UI

The [File UI module](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/tree/master/ChatSDKFirebase/FirebaseUI) allows you to use the native Firebase user interface for authentication.

After adding the files to your Xcode project, add the following to the App Delegate to enable the module.

**Objective C**

_AppDelegate.m -> application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:_

```
 #import "BFirebaseUIModule.h"

[[[BFirebaseUIModule alloc] init] activateWithProviders: @[]];
```

**Swift**

_[YourProject]-Bridging-Header.h_

```
 #import "BFirebaseUIModule.h"
```

_AppDelegate.swift_

```
BFirebaseUIModule.init().activate(withProviders: []);
```

You should pass in array of the `FUIAuthProvider` objects you want to support. 

Also add the following to your Podfile depending on which authentication methods you want to support:

```
pod 'FirebaseUI/Facebook', '~> 4.0'
pod 'FirebaseUI/Google', '~> 4.0'
pod 'FirebaseUI/Twitter', '~> 4.0'
pod 'FirebaseUI/Phone', '~> 4.0'
```

Then run `pod install`.

>**Note**
>If you want to Firebase Auth UI make sure you comment out the following line:

```
BNetworkManager.shared().a.auth().setChallenge(BLoginViewController.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil));
```

### Other Modules

For the following modules:

- [Keyboard overlay](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/keyboard-overlay/)
- [Sticker messages](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/sticker-messages/)
- [Contact book integration](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/contact-book-integration/)

These modules are distributed as development pods. After you've downloaded the module, unzip it and add it to the **ChatSDKModules** folder. Then:

1. Open your Podfile
2. Add the line:
  
  ```
  ChatSDKModules/[ModuleName], :path => "[Path to ChatSDKModules folder]"
  ```
3. Run `pod install`
4. In your _AppDelegate -> application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:_ add the following

  **Objective C**

  ```
  #import "B[ModuleName]Module.h"
  
  [[[B[ModuleName]Module alloc] init] activate];
  ```
  
  **Swift**

  __AppDelegate.swift__
  
  ```
  import ChatSDKModules
  
  B[Module Name]Module.init().activate()
  ```


#### Security Rules

Firebase secures your data by allowing you to write rules to govern who can access the database and what can be written. On the Firebase dashboard click **Database** then the **Rules** tab. 

Copy the contents of the [**rules.json**](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-ios/blob/master/rules.json) file into the rules and click publish.

## Integrating the Chat SDK with an existing login system

To start with, you should have completed the steps above to add the Chat SDK to your project. To integrate the Chat SDK we need to intercept three key events in your app:

- Login
- User profile update
- Logout

Once this is done, you will be able to access the Chat SDK API to perform actions like searching for users, creating threads and sending messages. 

When integrating the Chat SDK with an existing app it's best practice to create a new class with static methods to handle the lifecycle of the Chat SDK. This means that you can perform actions like setting the authentication token, updating the user and logging out from anywhere in your app. This also helps to separate the Chat SDK code from your own code. 

### Login

To integrate with a third party server two steps are necessary:

1. Generate an authentication token on your server
2. Pass the token to the Chat SDK

To generate a token, you should follow the Firebase [custom authentication guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens).

In PHP, an implementation may look like this:

```
// Get your service account's email address and private key from the JSON key file
$service_account_email = "abc-123@a-b-c-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com";
$private_key = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----...";

function create_custom_token($uid, $is_premium_account) {
  global $service_account_email, $private_key;

  $now_seconds = time();
  $payload = array(
    "iss" => $service_account_email,
    "sub" => $service_account_email,
    "aud" => "https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/google.identity.identitytoolkit.v1.IdentityToolkit",
    "iat" => $now_seconds,
    "exp" => $now_seconds+(60*60),  // Maximum expiration time is one hour
    "uid" => $uid,
    "claims" => array(
      "premium_account" => $is_premium_account
    )
  );
  return JWT::encode($payload, $private_key, "RS256");
}
``` 

>**Note:**  
>It is recommended to set the token expiry to a high value to prevent the case where the user is logged in to the server but not the Chat SDK.

The id should be the id your server uses to identify the user who is currently logged in. This token should be passed back to the app. Then the user can be authenticated as follows:

**Objective C**

```
[[BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.auth authenticateWithDictionary:@{bLoginTypeKey: @(bAccountTypeCustom),
bLoginCustomToken: token}].thenOnMain(^id(id<PUser> user) {
    // Login Success
    return Nil;
}, ^id(NSError * error) {
    // Login Failure
    return Nil;
});
```

**Swift**

```
let dict = [bLoginTypeKey: bAccountTypeCustom.rawValue, bLoginCustomToken: token] as [String : Any]

let promise = BNetworkManager.shared().a.auth().authenticate(with: dict)
_ = promise!.promiseKitThen().then { (result: Any?) in
    if (result is Error) {
        // Login Failure
    }
    else {
        // Login Success
    }
    return AnyPromise.promiseWithValue(result)
}

```

>**Note:**  
>This code could be added as a static function to the Chat SDK handler class as mentioned above. 

### User integration

The Chat SDK uses CoreData to persist it's data. This includes a user object which is used to store the current user's information. 

Whenever the user updates their details in your app, they should also update the information that is used by Chat SDK. 

```
id<PUser> user = [BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.core.currentUserModel;

user.name = @"Name goes here";
user.email = @"Email goes here";
user.phoneNumber = @"Number goes here"

// Set the 
[user setImage:UIImagePNGRepresentation(image)];
[user setThumbnail:UIImagePNGRepresentation(thumbnail)];

// Upload the image and thumbnail if necessary
[[BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.upload uploadImage:image thumbnail:thumbnail].thenOnMain(^id(NSDictionary * urls) {
    
    // Set the paths to the image and thumbnail
    [user setMetaString:urls[bImagePath] forKey:bUserPictureURLKey];
    [user setMetaString:urls[bThumbnailPath] forKey:bUserPictureURLThumbnailKey];
    
    // Update the user profile on Firebase
    [[BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.core pushUser];
    
    return urls;
}, Nil);
```

### Logging out

When your user logs out of the app, they should also log out of the Chat SDK. 

**Objective C**

```
[[BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.auth logout];
```

**Swift**

```
BNetworkManager.shared().a.auth().logout()
```

## Using the Chat SDK API

The Chat SDK API is based around the network manager and a series of handlers. A good place to start is by looking at the handlers `Pods/Development Pods/ChatSDK/Core/Core/Classes/Interfaces`. Here you can review the handler interfaces which are well documented. To use a handler you would use the following code:

**Objective C**

```
[[BNetworkManager sharedManager].a.handler_name function: to: call:]
```

**Swift**

```
BNetworkManager.shared().a.handler_name() function: to: call:]
```

##### Searching for a user

For example, to search for a user you could use the search handler:

```
-(RXPromise *) usersForIndexes: (NSArray *) indexes withValue: (NSString *) value limit: (int) limit userAdded: (void(^)(id<PUser> user)) userAdded;
```

Here you pass in a series of indexes to be used in the search i.e. name, email etc... and a value. It will then return a series of user objects. 

You can also see example implementations of these handlers by looking at the `BFirebaseSearchHandler` class. And also seeing how the method is used in the Chat SDK. 

##### Starting a chat 

To start a chat you can use the core handler. 

```
-(RXPromise *) createThreadWithUsers: (NSArray *) users
                       threadCreated: (void(^)(NSError * error, id<PThread> thread)) thread;
```

When this method completes, the thread will have been created on Firebase and all the users will have been added. You could then open the thread using the interface adapter. 

```
UIViewController * chatViewController = [[BInterfaceManager sharedManager].a chatViewControllerWithThread:thread];
```

So a more complete example would look like this:

```
-(void) startChatWithUser {
    MBProgressHUD * hud = [MBProgressHUD showHUDAddedTo:self.view animated:YES];

## Troubleshooting Cocoapods

1. Always open the .xcworkspace file rather than .xcodeproj
2. Check CocoaPod warnings - make sure to fix any warnings before proceeding
3. Make sure that your base configuration isn’t set: Project -> project name -> Info -> Configuration
4. Make sure that the “Build Active Architecture Only” setting is the same for both the main project and the pods project. 
5. Check the build settings in the Xcode project and check which fields are in bold (this means that their value has been overridden and CocoaPods can't access them). If you press backspace while selecting those fields, their values will be set to the default value.
